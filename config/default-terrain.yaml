## There are 5 different terrain types defined in this project -- mesh, box, stairs, slopes, random.
#
## For "mesh" terrain, the grid size, mesh location and heightmap file name need to be specified.
## For "box" terrain, the box size(l,w,h) and box location need to be specified.
## For "stairs" terrain, the number of stair steps, step height, step depth, stair width and stair location need to be specified.
## For "slopes" terrain, the slope degrees, slope width, slope length and slope location need to be specified.
## For "random" terrain, the area range of it, the size range of obstacles and terrain location need to be specified.
#
## In addition, more complicated terrain can be created by combining above 5 basic terrain elements.
## For example, Stair-bridge can be built by using box and 2 stairs, and Slope-bridge can be founded by using box and 2 slopes.
